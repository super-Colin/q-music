# Q Music

The goal of this project is to create a proof of concept for a new type of music production and listening, I've decided to call it "Quantum Music" in the hopes that the name might draw some interest... and because your tracks are in a super-position of the possibilities until you play it (sort of right???)

## The WHAT

With this project I would like to end up with a piece of software that can play specially created audio files that can sound different from one listen to the next. 

This could be achieved in several ways, but for simplicity I'll be doing whatever method I find easiest to execute.

These "specially created" files will also require a piece of software to produce, which I will also be executing as simply as possible.

## The WHY

Because it's a really cool idea to me and it would be incredible if this concept took off and became an actual thing!

Waaaaaayyyy in the future *if* this idea continued to grow and people way smarter than me create players and DAWs that can use the GPS or other sensors on your phone, imagine that your favorite artist could alter the way you hear a song in predictable ways based on pretty much anything you can think of!
